--- PIPELINE ---
1. .wav or .mp3 input
    - for mp3 use minimp3
2. generate an array of the amplitude for each sample
    - using miniaudio
3. perform fft on the sample
    - using fftw3
4. translate the frequencies extracted by fft to a musical note
5. find when the note was played relative to a beat
6. transcribe

--- MODULES ---
    INPUT HANDLER
        minimp3 to generate samples
    FREQ ANALYSER
        generates frequencies given samples
    MUSIC ANALYSER
        generates the notes from given frequencies
    BEAT ANALYSER
        discoveres when beats land
    TIME ANALYSER
        discovers where the notes land relative to the beat
    TRANSCRIBER
        writes the transcribed music to some format
    (TENTATIVE) INTERACTIVES
        somehow generates this in a more common form (musical notation, etc)
